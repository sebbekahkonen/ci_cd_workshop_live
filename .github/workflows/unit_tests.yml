# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions



name: CI



# Controls when the workflow will run

  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]



 # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:



# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "unit_tests"
  unit_tests:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest



   # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3



     # Test with unittest
      - name: Test with unittest
        run: python -m unittest discover

  second_tests:
      # This job cannot start before the previous job has completed
      needs: unit_tests
    
      # The type of runner that the job will run on
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest



    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
